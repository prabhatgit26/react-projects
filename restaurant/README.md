# Bella Cucina : Where Every Meal Tells a Story.


Bella Cucina is a modern restaurant web application designed to simplify table reservations and enhance the dining experience. Built using React for a smooth and responsive user interface, the app offers seamless navigation for customers. The backend efficiently handles reservation requests, and the integrated booking form allows users to reserve tables directly. Upon submitting a reservation, the system automatically sends a confirmation email to the restaurant, ensuring a streamlined process for both the diner and the restaurant.
